# emerge-van
iOS Application, emerge-van is a placeholder name

The application delivers the total time to treatment at the 8 hospitals in the Vancouver Coastal Health system. 

For the travel time, the application calls the Mapbox distance-matrix api.
For wait time, the application calls from a web server of my own design hosted on the google cloud platform in a docker container. 

The application is currently functional, although I have not run much extensive testing. The application presents information in a UITableView, but further UI design is underway.
